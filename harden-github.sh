# harden-github.sh — Layer 3 of 3: server-side guardrails.
#
# This is the only layer an agent (or a developer in a hurry) cannot bypass.
# Layers 1 and 2 live in files on the developer's laptop; anyone can edit them,
# and `--dangerously-skip-permissions` turns Layer 1 off entirely. GitHub does
# not care what runs locally — if `main` requires a review, `gh pr merge` fails
# at the API, full stop.
#
# Treat Layers 1 and 2 as fast feedback that keeps agents out of trouble, and
# THIS as the control you actually rely on.
#
# Usage:
#   bash harden-github.sh <owner>/<repo>            # apply
#   bash harden-github.sh <owner>/<repo> --dry-run  # show what would change
#
# Requires: gh CLI, authenticated with admin rights on the repo.
